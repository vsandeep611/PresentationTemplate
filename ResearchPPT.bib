	abstract="Designing autonomic fault responses is difficult, particularly in large-scale systems, as there is no single `perfect' fault mitigation response to a given failure. The design of appropriate mitigation actions depend upon the goals and state of the application and environment. Strict time deadlines in real-time systems further exacerbate this problem. Any autonomic behavior in such systems must not only be functionally correct but should also conform to properties of liveness, safety and bounded time responsiveness. This paper details a real-time fault-tolerant framework, which uses a reflex and healing architecture to provide fault mitigation capabilities for large-scale real-time systems. At the heart of this architecture is a real-time reflex engine, which has a state-based failure management logic that can respond to both event- and time-based triggers. We also present a semantic domain for verifying properties of systems, which use this framework of real-time reflex engines. Lastly, a case study, which examines the details of such an approach, is presented.",
